TODO list
=========

HIGH PRIORITY:
* User process termination (normal condition or exception)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
* Add flags to vm_object and vm_mapping which will help to limit access of user app to such objects.
  For example, unmap of particular objects can be done only by kernel, as well as discovery and
  mapping of objects. User application must not touch kernel VM objects.

LOW PRIORITY:
*
