1. refs_count in structures of VM? When Inc and when Dec?
2. How Copy-on-Write will work?
2a. Multiple COWs of one object?
2b. Partial COW of object?
3. How Page-Fault handler will work?
4. Shared memory


We need:
soft_page_fault - can be called from software
hard_page_fault - on PageFault exception, calles sot_page_fault

Shadow chain:

obj1 -> obj2 -> obj3
 RO      RO      RW

parent is always RO
