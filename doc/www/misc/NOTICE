IMPORTANT NOTICE
----------------

  Due to sources snapshot tarballs are published very rarely it is strongly
recommended to use Subversion (SVN) repository of the project for obtaining
latest sources.
  To obtain sources using command-line SVN client it is enough to perform
checkout operation by the following command:

    "svn co https://phlox-os.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phlox-os phlox-os"

  Folder named "phlox-os" will be created inside the folder where operation was
executed and the sources will be downloaded into it.

Also sources browsing are available via Web access at:
    http://phlox-os.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phlox-os/

For more information about Subversion visit:

Windows users may download SVN client with graphical interface at:
