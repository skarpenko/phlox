 * PC non-volatile random access memory stuff
 *
 * "Non-volatile BIOS memory refers to the memory on a personal
 * computer motherboard containing BIOS settings and sometimes the
 * code used to initialize the computer and load the operating system.
 * The non-volatile memory was historically called CMOS RAM or just
 * CMOS because it traditionally used a low-power CMOS memory chip,
 * which was powered by a small battery when the system power was off.
 * The term remains in wide use in this context, but has also grown into
 * a misnomer." - Wikipedia
